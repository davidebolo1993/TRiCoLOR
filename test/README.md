These folders contain BAM files simulated with [VISOR] (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz719/5582674/) (accuracy ~ 0.9, reads length ~ 8000 bps, substitutions:insertions:deletions rate ~ 45:25:30, coverage ~ 50 X)
BAM files for SON and PARENT1 contain a heterozigous TR expansion
Normal TR is chr20:17553794-1755382 (15xAC), taken from the list of TRs availables for the GRCh38 human reference genome
Expanded TR is 115XAC (expansion of 100 motifs)
TRiCoLOR can be applied to identify and profile this expansion in both child and parents as explained in the [manual] (https://davidebolo1993.github.io/tricolordoc/)
