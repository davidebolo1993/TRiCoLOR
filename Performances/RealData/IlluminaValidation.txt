We evalutated TRiCoLOR performances on real data using publicly available ONT/ILLUMINA FASTQ from 1000 Genomes Projects, HG00733 sample.

FASTQ for ONT are available at: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/hgsv_sv_discovery/working/20180502_ONT_rebasecalled/.
Reads were aligned to GRCh38 reference genome: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/GRCh38_reference_genome/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa
The alignment was performed using minimap2 and samtools.

Final BAM was splitted by haplotype using Alfred (https://github.com/tobiasrausch/alfred) and the HG00733 phased SNPs, available at: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/hgsv_sv_discovery/working/20170323_Strand-seq_phased_FB+GATK_VCFs/HG00732_StrandS_SNVsetFP+GATK_phased.vcf.gz


FASTQ for ILLUMINA are available as described here: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/hgsv_sv_discovery/illumina_wgs.sequence.index.

For each FASTQ file and the FASTA reference, a FMI index has been created using the fmindexer.cpp which has been made available in this repository. A statically-linked binary for Linux has been also made available in the staticversions folder.
We run TRiCoLOR SENSoR and REFER on chr20 of the HG00733 ONT BAM generated and we validated all the tandem repeated variants discovered in the final BCF file using the validator.cpp which has been made available in this repository. A statically-linked binary for Linux has been also made available in the staticversions folder. 
Briefly, each VARIANT in the final BCF is extended until it is not found in reference. Once a VARIANT that is not in reference has been produced, this is searched in the Illumina FASTQ, allowing an edit-distance of 1. If the VARIANT (or one of its 1d neighbours) is found in Illumina FASTQ, is considered valid. If it is not possible to extend the VARIANT so that it is not present in REFERENCE or the VARIANT is shorter than Illumina FASTQ read but not found, it is considered not valid. If the VARIANT is longer then Illumina FASTQ read, it is impossible to validate with this approach and it's skipped.


This reference-free variant identification approach has already been described in: 


- Iqbal Z, Caccamo M, Turner I, Flicek P, McVean G. De novo assembly and genotyping of variants using colored de Bruijn graphs. Nat Genet. 2012 Jan 8;44(2):226-32.

Here is the result we get:


Total variants identified by TRiCoLOR REFER: 15451
Validated variants: 14926
Variants too long for illumina sequences: 53

TPR = Variants validated/ All variants = 14926/(15451-53) = 0.9693467
