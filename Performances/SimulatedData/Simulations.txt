We randomly chose a region containing tandem repetitions (microsatellites) from KnownRepetitions.bed (microsatellites for GRCh38 genome).
For each region randomly chosen we generated one haplotype containing either a contraction or an expansion of the known microsatellite and another containing no contraction or expansion.
Contractions and expansions had a size of 7 and were generated using VISOR (https://github.com/davidebolo1993/VISOR).
We run TRiCoLOR REFER on the diploid sample using -m/--motif equal to the length of the known repeated motif and --precisemotif parameters.
We simulated 100 times both for contractions and expansions.
We then evaluated Sensitivity and Specificity, Precision and Recall and the capability to discriminate the correct repeated motif of TRiCoLOR.

The simulator we used is included in the directory (Simulator.py)

The results we got were:

- For Sequence accuracy = 0.9 and Coverage >= 5 and <= 10:

-- Exact Expansion +- 1:

--- Sensitivity and Specificity: 1.0,0.91
--- Precision and Recall: 0.9174, 1.0
--- Core (correct motif, shifted motif, wrong motif ratios): 0.9,0.1,0.0

-- Exact Expansion +- 2:

--- Sensitivity and Specificity: 1.0,0.98
--- Precision and Recall: 0.98, 1.0
--- Core (correct motif, shifted motif, wrong motif ratios): 0.9,0.1,0.0 #same as before, obviously

-- Exact Contraction +-1:

--- Sensitivity and Specificity: 0.97,0.89
--- Precision and Recall: 0.8981, 0.97
--- Core (correct motif, shifted motif, wrong motif ratios): 0.935,0.065,0.0

-- Exact Contraction +-2:

--- Sensitivity and Specificity: 0.99,0.95
--- Precision and Recall: 0.9519, 0.99
--- Core (correct motif, shifted motif, wrong motif ratios): 0.935,0.065,0.0 #same as before, obviously
