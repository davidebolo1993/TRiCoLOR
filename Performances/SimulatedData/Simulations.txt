We randomly chose a region containing tandem repetitions (microsatellites) from KnownRepetitions.bed (microsatellites for GRCh38 genome), included in this directory. 
For each region randomly chosen we generated one haplotype containing either a contraction or an expansion of the known microsatellite and another containing no contraction or expansion.
Contractions and expansions had a size of 7 and modified haplotypes were generated using VISOR HACk (https://github.com/davidebolo1993/VISOR). Long reads simulation has been performed with VISOR LASeR: mean coverage for each haplotype is double the value of -c/--coveragemin in the Simulator.py script, accuracy is the mean accuracy for ONT data (0.9).
We run TRiCoLOR REFER on the diploid sample using -m/--motif equal to the length of the known repeated motif and --precisemotif parameter.
We simulated 100 heteroziogous samples for both contractions and expansions (one haplotype with contraction/expansion the other without contraction/expansion) for 2 levels of haplotype-coverage (5<=x<=10 and 10<=x<=20).
We then evaluated TRiCoLOR Sensitivity and Specificity, Precision and Recall and the capability to discriminate the correct repeated motif of the microsatellite.
The simulator we used is included in the directory (Simulator.py) and can be run in a python 3.6 environment with VISOR, TRiCoLOR and all their dependencies installed.
A python script to train different scansizes on data simulated with Simulator.py and generate plots and summaries to compute optimal entropy treshold for data with user-defined coverages and error-rates is also included in the directory (Trainer.py)
